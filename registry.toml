  "We've all seen massive repositories full of skills and agents that nobody ever uses... But I bet you haven't seen any like these. I treat prompts like code. RFC 2119 keywords everywhere along with XML tags make for much more controlled experience with unwieldy models.",
  "I actually update these because I use them every day. For 10 hours a day. I'm an automation freak. Coding is a byproduct. Something fails more than once? It will get updated.",
  "It's not the fish, it's the fishing rod (I swear I wrote it by hand). These packs enable you to one-shot a plugin, or... create a repo like this for yourself.",
